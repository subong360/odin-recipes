        <h3>How to prepare Yam and Egg Sauce </h3>
        <p>Egg sauce and boiled yam is one of the breakfast staples in Nigeria or should I say weekend breakfast.
            Boiled yam and egg sauce is very easy to make.  Typically in Nigeria, we use tomatoes, scotch bonnet chilli and onions in making this sauce.
             Feel free to make this your own, Egg sauce can also be eaten with Agege bread.
